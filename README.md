# Terragrunt tutorial

This repo aims to give a tutorial around some of the features that Terragrunt offers, with examples for each.

## What is Terragrunt?

[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) is a thin wrapper that overlays [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) that allows you to avoid having large amounts of repetition in your infrastructure as code, as well as helping with terraform modules and remote state.

Terraform is a great tool, but it does lend itself towards some duplication which can get harder to manage the larger your solution becomes.

## Example structure

The [main branch](https://github.com/paddymorgan84/terragrunt-tutorial/tree/main) shows you the infrastructure pre-terragrunt.

The [terragrunt branch](https://github.com/paddymorgan84/terragrunt-tutorial/tree/terragrunt) shows you all of the examples, with updated `README.md` for details
